# Welcome to our Final Project 
Note that client.py contains a couple additional features beyond frontend.py, however client.py hasn't been as rigorously tested

Must connect to Dartmouth VPN to run api.js, as we use our database on sunapee.

- To run js, enter the following in terminal: nodemon api.js  
- To run python front-end, enter the following in another terminal window: python frontend.py or python3 client.py
